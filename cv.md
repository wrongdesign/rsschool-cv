### A little about me

Hi, I'm 22 years old. I started my conscious life by studying at Gomel State Technical University with a degree in Information Technology and Management in Technical Systems. Psoel students decided not to stop in professional development and continued his studies in the master's degree. Today I am also a teacher of technical disciplines at one of the colleges in my city. But this work does not bring me pleasure, so I decided that I needed to develop in the field of Frontend development. Since I was a student, I have been very interested in programming, in the field of which I am developing to this day. With my zeal to learn something new, with my mathematical and at the same time creative mindset, I think I have chosen the right path in Frontend development.
